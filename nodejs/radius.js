/*****
 * This is the nodejs bootstrapper or nodejs loader for the Radius Software
 * development framework.  It's loaded within the HEAD element of the HTML
 * document supported with Radius.  It's primary job is to load in each of
 * the specified framework script files and wait for each file to be fully
 * compiled before moving on to the next script file.  This is importatn
 * because the order of evaluation is critical due to dependencies.  Note that
 * this script only loads the framework.  Once loaded, the framework will be
 * used for loading in developer application code, CSS, and HTML framents.
