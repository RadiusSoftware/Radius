/*****
 * Base class for HTTP Extensions, which are the cornerstone for the Radius
 * HTTP server strategy for adding extensive features.  An HTTP Extension,
 * also known as HttpX, is a HttpServerWorker class that provides a framework
 * for implementing server-side dynamic responses to requests.  This is the
 * basis for web applications and simpler algorithms such as realtime data
 * steaming.  What it does is accept an HTTP request and provides an frame-
 * work response employing following shape:
 * 
 *      return {
 *          status: 200,
 *          contentType: 'application/json',
 *          content: toJson({
 *              why: 'WHY',
 *              how: 'HOW',
 *          }),
 *      };
 * 
 * The calling HttpServerWorker will then place this response into the HTTP
 * response object to be sent back to the browser.  The base-class restful
 * handlers must be overriden by the subclass in order to make this functional.
