/*****
 * The framework encapsulation and enhancement of the browser's builtin in
 * websocket class.  One important featue is that the websocket can be either
 * connected or not.  When a user sends a message to the server, the websocket
 * wil automatically establish a new connection if not already connected.  This
 * ensures that we don't need to worry about Apple's aggressive socket-closing
 * functionality built into its browsers.  Also note that an automatical ping
 * function is started when the socket is connected so we don't need to worry
 * about aggressive time outs.  The application layer is then able to control
 * the socket-life duration.
