/*****
 * A Radius object wrapper for the mutation observer features provided by the
 * MDN browser framework.  The primary usage for this class within the framework
 * is to enable controller elements to emit mutation and other related events
 * as the controller's subtree is modified.  These events are provide the ability
 * to cleanly develop dynamic HTML, SVG, MATHML, and Widgets for an application.
